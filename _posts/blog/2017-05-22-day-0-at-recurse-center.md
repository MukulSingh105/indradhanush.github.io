I recently left my day job at [Instamojo](https://www.instamojo.com/)
to join [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), where I'll be
spending the next 12 weeks on becoming a better programmer. Today was
the first day and following are my notes on it:

The day started with a round of introductions by the RC staff, the
current batch(spring 2's) and our batch(summer 1's). It was
enthralling to meet a bunch of people from different countries, while
a lot of them came from non CS backgrounds like Math, Biology &
Neuroscience.

Someone said that you should set expectations from yourself, but also
be prepared to get rid of them.

I was both excited and nervous at the same time. The excitement came
from the opportunity to meet so many amazing people from a diverse set
of backgrounds, while the nervousness spun out of the uncertainty lying
ahead of me. It turns out, a lot of fellow recursers felt the same and
it was definitely relieving to know that I was not alone. Dave and
Nick ran an exercise where everyone spoke about what made them excited
and nervous. These looked like this:

## Excited
* Pair programming
* Meeting everyone
* To have a break
* To make a difference
* Find a community
* C++
* Meeting everyone
* Becoming a better programmer

## Nervous
* Reaching the goals
* Slacking off
* Big city
* Getting stuck
* Not making the best use of this time
* Getting lost with so much information
* Summer 1's being twice as large as Spring 2's

## Choosing and scoping projects

After a brief introduction we had a discussion led by a few spring 2's
on _Choosing and scoping projects_. This seemed to be a very common
concern among the new recursers and spring 2's helped us with advice
on this:

* Embrace the
  [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) - At RC,
  there's always a lot of things happening simultaneously and it is
  natural to want to do all of them. However, it is perfectly fine to
  miss out on a few things.
* Use the first week to not do any of your own work. Rather use it to
  talk to others and look out for things you could work together.
* Constantly self reflect on your goals and progress towards
  them. Re-calibrate accordingly.
* You could hit a barrier while pursuing a project and not seem to be
  able to make any progress. If you are stuck for more than a day,
  this is a good time to take a step back and assess the barrier. Ask
  yourself if it is relevant to the goals you've set for yourself. If
  not, feel free to ignore it completely.
* Keep things moving: While working on a project, things might get
  repetitive after a while. Feel free to switch contexts. Leave the
  repetitive work for later, because the end goal is to learn as much
  as new stuff as possible.
* Work outside your comfort zone. Each day it keeps getting higher and
  higher. Keep pushing yourself to stay outside the comfort zone at all
  times.
* Spend some time at the end of the day to reflect upon what you
  accomplished in the day and note down what you learned out of
  it. Zulip check-ins are a great idea.
* Have a sidetrack project. It could be something like learning a new
  programming language or a small script that you've always wanted to
  write. This helps when you hit a wall in your main project and can't
  seem to be able to move forward. A switch in context helps.
* Sometimes half finished projects are as good as finished projects,
  because of what you learned out of working on them.
* Publishing projects is a lot of work. Documentation. Cleaning up
  stuff. Don't look to publish something because it takes a lot of
  time. Feel free to work on something else when you've learned what
  you wanted to out of a project.
* There will be a constant struggle in finding the right compromise
  between breadth and depth.
* If you are stuck at something, talk to someone.
* If you constantly feel like a project is a burden, it is a good idea
  to stop working on it.
* Sometimes you could find yourself at a cross roads with a lot of
  ways to do the same things. Consult someone else. Try not to get
  lost thinking about all the different ways.
* Scope out your projects well enough before you start writing
  code. You should have a clear picture of what you've set out to do.

## Creating your own structure and accountability

This was followed by a similar discussion on _Creating your own
structure and accountability_. RC is completely self directed. One
could play games or browse Facebook all day and no one would bat an
eye. As a result this was another common concern amongst the
newbies. Here are a few points that came out of this:

* A fixed routine is helpful. But also don't be too rigid about it all
  the time.
* Set your own goals.
* Try the pomodoro technique to get things done. Set a 25 minute timer
  and turn off all distractions. You should scope out a task to be
  completed within that 25 minutes and stick to it. It will help you
  stay focused at the task in hand.
* Get into a flow of state. This could something like cleaning up
  code or rearranging a few segments of code. This helps you get
  started if you are struggling on that.
* Pair program with someone else. Be the navigator.
* Share your work with others. This drives you to stick to your
  goals.
* Someone also suggested to look into Hammock Driven Development. The
  idea is to step away from the computer and think about the problem
  at hand, maybe with a pen and a paper.

## Common struggles and how people deal with them

The last discussion on the day was on _Common struggles and how people
deal with them_. This started with funny debugging stories.

* Talk out loud when stuck. Use rubber duck debugging. There are a few
  rubber ducks at RC as well.
* Your priorities can change over time. Adjust your expectations along
  the way.
* Do not try to learn everything at once. Step back and simplify
  things.
* Everyone has their own methodology. Feel free to find your own.


After a short break, recursers did a bunch of 5 minute
presentations. Each of them were unique and fun to watch. The day
ended with a quick reminder about the RC social rules, which are:

* No feigning surprises
* No "well actuallys"
* No backseat driving
* No subtle -isms

It has been a long time since I met so many people in a single day,
and the first time that I was sharing the same roof with people from
such a wide range of backgrounds. It indeed was an overwhelming day
with a lot of information flowing in. All the people at RC are very
friendly and welcoming. They are all interested in what the other
person has done so far and wants to do in the future.

Here's to an amazing 12 weeks!
