Getting feedback is important, they say. But no one ever tells you how
to do it effectively. Wherever I go, I make it a point to ask for
feedback. Sometimes I have been able to get great constructive
feedback, while I've failed on other occasions. While it has largely
been a hit and miss, I have a collected some thoughts on what makes a
hit vs. what makes a miss.

So instead of asking a generic question of the form "do you have any
feedback for me", try the following next time:

## 1. Ask well scoped questions

Think of that project you worked on, or that feature you helped
implement. Ask if there was anything your manager or teammates thought
that could have been done differently. Ask if there was anything in
that project that they thought you did really well. You should try to
pin down a topic of discussion that lets them focus on one and one
thing only. Finding good or bad points from a single topic is easier.

## 2. Ask open ended but well directed questions

Okay, this is in slight contrast to 1 above. Ask questions like "Is
there anything that you would like me to do more of?" or "Is there
anything that you think I should stop doing?". The idea behind these
questions is that you do not want the other party to have to think
hard when asking for feedback. Everyone is as busy as they can be, and
asking for more out of their busy schedule makes it unlikely that you
would get any constructive feedback. Asking questions that are limited
in scope makes it easier to come up with an answer.

Questions like "do you have anything to add?" put the burden of
thinking on others. Your goal should be to remove any mental overhead
from others.

## 3. Don't ask for anonymous feedback

More often than not, anonymous feedback lacks context. Maybe someone
didn't like a joke you cracked over a team lunch and an anonymous
person mentioning that in feedback means you do not know who is the
offended person. Maybe everyone had a good laugh about it. But you
failed to notice the one who didn't. Knowing exactly who helps to make
the feedback more contextual. A feedback is only as good as in the
context it is provided.

## 4. Don't ask people to rate you on specific qualities

When you ask how much would someone rate you on say, effective
communication on a scale of 1 to 10, and they rate you an 8. You may
have expected a 10 since you feel you communicate well, but the other
person might feel that 8 means pretty good. Scales vary from one
person to another.

If you must ask people to rate you, also ask them the reason for
deducting points. If they deducted two points off your rating, ask
them to mention the reasoning behind that. Ideally, they should have
two bad experiences if they deducted two points.

And prefer a scale of 1 to 5 instead of 1 to 10. Limited options means
less things to worry about. It makes it easy to put a number when on a
smaller scale. How would you feel if someone asked you to rate
their communication skills on a scale of 1 to 100? Would you rate them
an 86 or an 87? And what is the difference between 86 and 87 anyway?

## 5. Be proactive in asking for feedback

Remember that this is feedback about you. As a result it becomes
solely your responsibility to ask for it. Most people would be happy
to give feedback when asked, but feel shy to give it out without being
asked for it, for the risk of offending you.

As a result, set yourself a reminder to ask for feedback.


*The last two points are more about what to do when you get feedback.*

## 6. Take notes

Write it down. Revisit it in a few weeks and see if you feel like
you've acted upon it. Rinse. Repeat.

## 7. All feedback is just feedback

The Oxford dictionary defines the word *feedback* as:

> Noun
>
> Information about reactions to a product, a person's performance of a
> task, etc. which is used as a basis for improvement.


Feedback is largely what someone else felt about you. At the end of
the day you know yourself the best. Use the feedback along with your
own judgement to improve upon yourself. If you are not thoroughly
convinced by someone's feedback, talk to someone who knows you well
and discuss it with them. What do they feel about it? Do they think
the feedback is appropriate or misguided? Talk to multiple people if
you must.

And finally I'd like to end this post with the following quote from
the movie, *Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time*:

> A true King considers the advice of counsel but always listens to
> his heart.
