If you didn't get the reference to the bash command above already, I
am a command line nerd and I type at ~90wpm.

I just finished my batch at the
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I spent my time to
become a [better programmer](/tags/#recurse-center).

Previously, I was at [Instamojo](https://www.instamojo.com/) for
almost three years where I worked across almost the entire backend
codebase and spent some significant time on the infrastructure team.

I write about programming and very [recently](/tags/#human-behaviour) on
human behaviour. Distributed sytems and network programming pique my
interest.

When not thinking about code, I play the drums or I
[paint](/paintings/).

Oh and if you are up for it, lets type race here
[http://play.typeracer.com/](http://play.typeracer.com/). Should be
fun!
