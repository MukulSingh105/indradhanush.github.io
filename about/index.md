If you didn't get the reference to the bash command above already, I
am a command line nerd and I type at ~90wpm.

I am currently at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)
 spending my time to become a better programmer.

Previously, I worked at [Instamojo](https://www.instamojo.com/) where
I worked on the product, built internal tools and libraries and spent
some time with the infrastructure team as well.

I write about programming and very [recently](/blog/memories/) on
human behaviour. Distributed sytems and network programming pique my
interest.

When not thinking about code, I play the drums or I
[paint](/paintings/).

Oh and if you are up for it, lets type race here
[http://play.typeracer.com/](http://play.typeracer.com/). Should be
fun!
