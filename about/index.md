If you didn't get the reference to the bash command above already, I
am a command line nerd and I type at ~90wpm. I have been programming
for close to ten years, five of them professionally.

I'm currently having a lot of fun working remotely from India in the
containers and distributed systems space at
[Kinvolk](https://kinvolk.io). Prior to that I attended the [Recurse
Center](https://www.recurse.com/), where I spent my time in becoming a
[better programmer](/tags/#recurse-center).

I write about programming and very [recently](/tags/#human-behaviour)
on human behaviour. Distributed sytems and network programming pique
my interest.

When not thinking about code, I play the drums or I
[paint](/paintings/).

Oh and if you are up for it, lets type race here
[http://play.typeracer.com/](http://play.typeracer.com/). Should be
fun!
