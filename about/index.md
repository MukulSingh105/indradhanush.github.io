If you didn't get the reference to the bash command above already, I
am a command line nerd and I type at ~90wpm.

I work in the engineering team at
[Instamojo](https://www.instamojo.com/) where we are building the
future of payments. Apart from working on the product, building
internal tools and libraries, these days I'm working on the
infrastructure that powers it all.

I write about programming and very [recently](/blog/memories/) on
human behaviour. Distributed sytems and network programming pique my
interest

When not thinking about code, I play the drums or I
[paint](/paintings/).

Oh and if you are up for it, lets type race here
[http://play.typeracer.com/](http://play.typeracer.com/). Should be
fun!
