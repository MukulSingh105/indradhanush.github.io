* I wanted to write an HTTP load balancer and a distributed shell
* Spoke to Saul about Operating Systems. I might write a toy OS
  instead.
* Day 1 ended with me looking into some calculus, which I had not
  anticipated at all. How's that for serendipity? (David had mentioned
  about this during the first interview)

* Math has always scared me, but even though my reading involves some
  math now, I am motivated to dig deep and understand that.

* Katrina helped me with some math that I was having a hard time to
  understand here:

* Bit hard to find someone to pair with me on my project. ML and
  Compilers has a large group. Also LLVM.

* Load balancer 101 notes in notebook.

* Shell 101 video

* Spoke to Nicole about purchasing a bike in depth. She was very helpful.

* Someone broke one of the social rules, by doing a "well actually",
  but the nice thing was that they corrected themselves
  immediately. So that doesn't count as a rule break.

* Spoke to Saul about my project ideas (lb and distributed shell). LB
  feels a bit abstract right now. Its a good idea to start with the
  shell instead.
  
* Joe Ardent helped over Zulip

* I thought I understood fork. I was wrong. It returns twice. On the
  same variable. 

* How come sleep() doesn't block the `if-block` of a `fork`
