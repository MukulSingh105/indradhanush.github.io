This is a collection of quotes that I keep stumbling upon on the internet and in books and from the people I meet.

> If you want to build a ship,

> divide the work, and give orders.
> Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.

> --- Antoine De Saint-Exupery, Author of The Little Prince

>If you don't understand, ask questions. If you're uncomfortable about asking questions, say you are uncomfortable about asking questions and then ask anyway. It's easy to tell when a question is coming from a good place. Then listen some more. Sometimes people just want to feel heard. Here's to possibilities of friendship and connection and understanding.

> ---  Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Americanah

> The truth. It is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution
>
> --- Albus Dumbledore
